I would like a ground up, complete SaaS solution for a new product called MCP Everything (mcpeverything.com). This plan is to serve as the blueprints for Claude Code (or another AI coding tool) to keep true on. The purpose of the app is to allow any user to interface with a multimodal chat powered by a leading AI LLM behind the scenes. The user can describe what they want to provide an MCP Server for. They can provide anything they would like, and we will try and break down the task into understandable chunks such that we can surface usable MCP Tools. A trivial, but common example I am think of would be someone dropping in a GitHub repo link. We should possess the ability to crawl, understand, and provide an MCP Server to wrap API endpoints within that repo. However, we should not limit our ability to this. Another example could be a simple description about a tool. Lets say Google Docs. We should have the ability to deeply research what is required to sufficiently provide an MCP server for Google Docs and how to consume the API that enables it to work. With authentication, we will need to brainstorm how to provide this passthrough to the user in some way. Most non public endpoints, for example, will need auth. Either by providing a key for the session, SSO, or OAuth 2.0. A 1 click, hosting option should be in mind. Lets start with Stripe payment collection. Another big point, is this MCP tech will emerge to be a primary way for agentic systems to leverage existing APIs. So building the system to be available to agents, and not just humans, should be equal priority.

The app should be built in mind for containerization on tech like Docker or Kubernetes. Built like this allows the parts of the app to be scalable and highly available. Ideally, I am most familiar with Angular for the frontend, and Nest.js for backend side. Such that shared Typing can help during development. However, I am open to any technology so long that it presents a valuable position. To help get the ball rolling, some key features of the app will be an AI Research engine (this can be many orchestrated LLMs), which takes intent and breaks it down with respect to MCP tools. Then an MCP Server builder, powered by AI (again, can and should be many LLMs/ sub task agents). Which takes the provided previous context/report, and constructs, from scratch, a complete and working MCP Server. The other aspect is hosting. We should provide the ability to host this MCP Server on our app. This would lead to a discovery marketplace of available MCP Servers to consume/search. Hosting will our main revenue aspect, but I'm open to additional business models. The application should be simplistic in design, nothing trying to be catchy. a monochrome color scheme is good to start. A very simple landing page which allows the user to immediately interface with the MCP Builder chat interface, or easily find the already Hosted MCP Servers via the marketplace. Once we have constructed the MCP Server (complete with passing tests/documentation ect) we should provide perhaps a github link for the user. This in my head would be free, such that we could provide value to folks. If they want to take that and host it somehwere, great. But my hope is that we can make it easy to host their MCP Server. We might need to think of DNS routing, for business ect and how that will work. I am hesitant to charge for everything as I don't want to scare people away, rather I want to be the primary place people/LLMs/Agentic systems come to build and consome MCP Servers.

This application will need to have it own MCP Server to consume. As this would allow models to easily consume our technology and provide end users an MCP path. Google just announced AP2 (https://github.com/google-agentic-commerce/AP2), with will work with A2A (https://github.com/a2aproject/A2A). I can see our applicaiton providing MCP agents for a charge. Where we can have our own agent searching against the marketplace to handle tool calls/envokations/or suggestions. I would imagine we would want to embed and vectorize all hosted MCP Servers and their available tool offerings, such that we could search with semantics, rather than text-matching.

You will need a comprehensive understanding of Model Context Protocol (MCP): https://modelcontextprotocol.io/

Think hard and take your time, but ask me any clarifying questions before you being your study.
